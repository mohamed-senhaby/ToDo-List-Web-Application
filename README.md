# ToDo-List Web Application

The ToDo-List web application is a simple task management tool that allows users to organize their tasks for the current day and work-related tasks separately. The application is built using Node.js, Express.js, and the EJS templating engine.


## Usage

### Today's Tasks

- To view and manage tasks for the current day, go to the "Today" page by clicking on the "Today" link in the navigation bar.

- On the "Today" page, you will see a list of tasks for the current day. Each task will have a checkbox that you can check off when a task is completed.

- To add a new task, use the input field at the bottom of the page. Type your task and click the "+" button to add it to the list.

### Work Tasks

- To view and manage work-related tasks, go to the "Work" page by clicking on the "Work" link in the navigation bar.

- On the "Work" page, you will see a list of tasks specifically for work. Like the "Today" page, each task will have a checkbox.

- To add a new work-related task, use the input field at the bottom of the page. Type your task and click the "+" button to add it to the list.

### Saving Tasks

- The application automatically saves the tasks in memory, so your tasks will persist as long as the server is running.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime that allows executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
- Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that handles HTTP requests and routes.
- EJS (Embedded JavaScript): A templating engine that allows embedding JavaScript code within HTML templates to generate dynamic content.
- jQuery: A fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library that simplifies client-side scripting and manipulation of HTML documents.
